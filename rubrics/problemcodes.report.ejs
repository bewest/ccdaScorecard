## Some problem codes weren't in the *[HITSP Problem List](http://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?oid=2.16.840.1.113883.3.88.12.3221.7.4)* value set, consisting of 16K codes from SNOMED CT.

Note: This may be normal, if this C-CDA document includes unusual problems for which no appropriate SNOMED code exists.  But look through the un-matched codes below to make sure you don't have a mapping error in your export pipeline.
