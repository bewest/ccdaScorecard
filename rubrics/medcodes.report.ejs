## Some drug codes weren't in the *[HITSP Medication List](http://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?oid=2.16.840.1.113883.3.88.12.80.17)*.

This Medication List value set consists of 31K codes from RxNorm.

Note: This may be normal, if this C-CDA document includes unusual drugs for which no appropriate RxNorm code exists.  But look through the un-matched codes below to make sure you don't have a mapping error in your export pipeline.
